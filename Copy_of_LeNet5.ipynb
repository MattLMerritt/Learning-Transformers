        "## Why Analog AI\n",
        "\n",
        "In-memory computing hardware increases the speed and energy-efficiency needed for the next steps in AI. Analog AI delivers radical performance improvements by combining compute and memory in a single device, eliminating the von Neumann bottleneck. \n",
        "Based on von Neumann architecture, conventional computers perform calculations by repeatedly transferring data between the memory and processor. These trips require time and energy, negatively impacting performance. This is known as the von Neumann bottleneck. \n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://github.com/IBM-AI-Hardware-Center/aihwkit-notebooks/blob/main/examples/imgs/processing-unit-and-computional-memory.png?raw=1\"  alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width=50px;\"/> \n",

        "\n",
        "By leveraging the physical properties of in-memory computing devices (example: Phase Change Memory or PCM), computation happens at the same place where the data is stored, drastically reducing energy consumption. Because there is no movement of data, tasks can be performed in a fraction of the time and with much less energy. This is different from a conventional computer, where the data is transferred from the DRAM memory to the CPU every time a computation is done. For example, moving 64 bits of data from DRAM to CPU consumes 1-2nJ, which is 10,000–2,000,000 times more energy than is dissipated in a PCM device performing a multiplication operation (1-100fJ). Also, PCM does not consume power when the devices are inactive, and the data will be retained for up to 10 years even when the power supply is turned off. \n",
        "\n",
        "## The physics behind PCM\n",
        "\n",
        " With PCM, when an electrical pulse is applied to the material, it changes the [conductance](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Electrical_conductance) of the device by switching the material between amorphous and crystalline phases. A low electrical pulse will make the PCM device more crystalline (less resistance), this pulse can be repeatedly applied to gradually decrease the device resistance. On the other hand, the material change from the crystalline phase (low resistance) to the amorphouse phase (high resistance) is quite abrupt and requires a high electrical pulse to RESET the device. Therefore, it is possible to records the states as a continuum of values between the two extremes, instead of encoding 0 or 1 like in the digital world.\n",
        "\n",
        "PCM devices have the ability to store synaptic weights in their analog conductance state. When PCM devices are arranged in a crossbar configuration, it allows to perform an analog matrix-vector multiplication in a single time step, exploiting the advantages of multi-level storage capability and Kirchhoff’s circuits laws. The figure below shows how PCM devices are arranged in a crossbar configuration. \n",

        "\n",
        "This crossbar configuration is also referred to as an Analog tile. The PCM devices at each crossbard crosspoint are also referred to as Resitive Processing Units or RPU units as shown in the figure below:\n",

        "\n",
        "Besides PCM, other devices or materials can be used as resistive units or RPUs in the crossbar configuration. Examples include Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM), Electro chemical Random Access Memory (ECRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), photonics, etc. The weights of neural network are stored in the RPU units as confuctance values that are programmed on the chip through as series of electrical pulses. The conductance behavior changes from one analog device to another. \n",

        "\n",
        "## Analog AI and Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "In deep learning inference, data propagation through multiple layers of a neural network involves a sequence of matrix multiplications, as each layer can be represented as a matrix of synaptic weights. On an Analog chip, these weights are stored in the conductance states of resistive devices such as PCM. The devices are arranged in crossbar arrays, creating an artificial neural network where all matrix multiplications are performed in-place in an analog manner. This structure allows inference to be performed using little energy with high areal density of synapses. An in-memory computing chip typically consists of multiple crossbar arrays of memory devices that communicate with each other (see figure below). A neural network layer can be implemented on (at least) one crossbar, in which the weights of that layer are stored in the charge or conductance state of the memory devices at the crosspoints.\n",

The conductance change of a ReRAM device is bidirectional, that is, it is possible to both increase and decrease its conductance incrementally by applying suitable electrical pulses. This capability can be exploited to implement the backpropagation algorithm. The change of conductance in oxide ReRAM is attributed to change in the configuration of the current conducting filament which consists of oxygen vacancies in a metal oxide film. \n",

This device was fabricated with hafnium oxide as the metal oxide switching layer. The preset captures the experimentally measured response of this device to 1000 positive and 1000 negative pulses (shown in Figure 3a), including the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations. The movement of the oxygen vacancies in response to electrical signals has a probabilistic nature and it emerges as inherent randomness in conductance changes. Realistic device-to-device variability is also included in the preset to appropriately simulate the behavior of an array of such devices. \n",
